# Flutter Project Overview

This Flutter application utilizes a fake API provided by [dummyjson.com](https://dummyjson.com/) for testing and demonstration purposes.

## Key Features:

- **Code Generation:** The project leverages code generation tools including Freezed, Retrofit, and Injectable for efficient and fast development.

- **MVVM Architecture:** The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern to ensure a clean and organized codebase.

- **State Management:** The Provider package is employed for effective state management, enhancing the overall application's scalability and maintainability.

## Weaknesses:

Despite its notable features, the app has a few areas that can be improved:

1. **Bad UX/UI:** The user experience and user interface need refinement to enhance the overall usability and aesthetics.

2. **Non-Native Splash Screen:** The splash screen is currently non-native, and using a native splash screen could provide a more seamless app launch experience.

3. **Missing Launch Icon:** The app lacks a launch icon, which is a key visual element for brand identity and user recognition.

These weaknesses present opportunities for enhancement, contributing to a more polished and user-friendly application.
